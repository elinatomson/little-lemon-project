# Booking a table on the Little Lemon website

This project is part of my journey through the ["Meta Front-End Developer"](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer) course on Coursera.

The goal was to apply front-end development skills to create a website for Little Lemon restaurant, featuring a table booking form.

Through this project, I practiced:
- Designing and styling a responsive User Interface (UI) for both desktop and mobile views.
- Using React components to organize the site into multiple sections and views.
- Creating a booking form functionality with validations.
- Building a front-end with React JS and JavaScript.
- Applying best practices for accessibility and usability, to ensure a user-friendly experience.
- Writing unit tests with Jest to validate functionality.
